# A.I. Adventures

> A W.I.P. collection of AI-generated stories where the user takes on the role of the main character. Initially envisioned as a platform for creative authors to share their original interactive tales, the project currently focuses on AI-crafted adventures. Regardless, each story offers a unique "Choose Your Own Adventure" experience, complete with multiple branching paths and over a dozen different endings. Whether generated by AI or written by authors, the platform caters to users seeking immersive and one-of-a-kind narrative journeys.

## Installation


**Summary**
* Install Python
* Clone the repo
* Set up a virtual environment
* Install dependencies from requirements.txt
* Run the app with flask run

**Instructions**

**1.** Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**2.** Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeidiGrace2006/code50/93442894.git
cd code50/93442894
```

**3.** Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good idea to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
**4.** Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated (or if you are skipping it), install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**5.** Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)
If your application relies on any environment variables (e.g., for secret keys, database URIs, etc.), you should create a .env file and define them. Example:

```bash
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

**6.** Running the Application
To run the application, use the Flask CLI:

```bash
flask run
```
The application should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your browser to access it.

If the flask command is not found, make sure that the FLASK_APP environment variable is set correctly or try running:

```bash
python -m flask run
```
## About The Project & Development Choices

When I set out to create a Choose Your Own Adventure platform, I had no idea how much I would need to learn along the way. As I acquired new skills, my original vision began to shift. At first, I was manually formatting each template, but soon recognized the value of tools like Bootstrap to speed up and simplify the design process.

I had also initially planned to store all my data in SQL, including the user database, custom stories, and individual user progress. After facing challenges with that approach, a fellow programmer recommended exploring JSON for data formatting. Following this advice, I transitioned to using JSON for storing the stories.

To further challenge myself, I incorporated additional features such as the ability to restart stories, custom images for each adventure (displayed as a "card" on the homepage, as well as headers and footers on story pages), and what I hadn't originally planned but was delighted to achieveâ€” dynamic templates. This now allows for a flexible number of choices, varying chapter lengths, and multiple possible endings, breaking free from the constraints of a fixed structure.
