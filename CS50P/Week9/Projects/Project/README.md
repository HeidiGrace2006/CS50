# Icecream Inquiry (A Hangman Alternative)
## Video Demo: https://youtu.be/1q3cXMmJnG0
### Description:
This program is a fun and innovative spin on the classic game, 'hangman', in which you have to guess a word, letter by letter, within a certain amount of guesses. The program is very user friendly, including a tutorial if you've never played before. The twist is that instead of a man being hung more visibly with each incorrect guess, an icecream cone is being eaten before your eyes. You can choose between the categories plants, animals, music, biology, desserts, or, if you're up for the challenge, a word is randomly selected from all of the categories combined. The program uses a mix of lists, dictionaries, functions, and more to work successfully. One unique aspect of this program that I really wanted to capture was the 'personality' of the game master. Instuctional text is typed out as if a person were typing it, rather than being instantly printed. Responses are less systematic, and are more personal. Overall, it's a fun and easy game for any age.
### Challenges:
While creating a 'mini-game' such as hangman seemed very simple to me at first, it proved to be challenging in more ways than one. I think my biggest challenge was breaking up my code into testable functions, as I initally had the majority of the program under a "gameplay" function and called it good. Through writing this program I learned how to use list and dictionary comprehension, as well as generator expressions.
### Implementation Details:
There were no installations used in this program, only built in Python libraries such as random, time, and sys.
