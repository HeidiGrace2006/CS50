            What are my intrests?
            <p>
                <h3>
                    For starters, coding!<br>
                    My first encounter with coding (apart from Scratch in elementary school) was in a highschool computers class my freshmen year.<br>
                    I loved it. Prior to this I had started to become bored with school. Public school classes were too easy, and most of the work was busy work.<br>
                    Coding, however, made me think differently. I was forced to problem solve. To learn something entirely new.<br>
                    It was the first time I felt like a passion was a realistic career for me.<br><br>

                    But one of my <i>favorite</i> intrests has always been piano.<br>
                    I've taken piano lessons for 11 years, and have never lost intrest in the slightest.<br>
                    One of the reasons I fell in love with learning coding was because it reminded me of learning piano:<br>
                    something fun, challenging, an unlike the other skills in my day-to-day life.<br>
                    Now that I've graduated, I'm moving on from piano lessons. But I hope I never move on from piano.<br><br>

                    <br>Some other various intrests include:<br>
                    anything outdoors (camping, hiking, kayaking, dirt bike riding, rock climbing, you name it),<br>
                    animals, participating with church and youth groups, baking, gaming, organizing, and bargain shopping.<br>
