            What are my plans for the future?
            <p>
                <h3>
                    Currently I am still trying to figure out what my plans are for what's next.<br>
                    I know that I would like to pursue computer coding and back-end website development.<br>
                    To do so I may take more CS50 courses, attend a coding bootcamp, travel to some tech conferences, or maybe even go to college.<br>
                    My goal is to someday be able to work from anywhere, anytime, so that I can focus on what really matters in life.<br>
                    Before then I will do my best to learn all that I can!<br><br>
                </h3>
