            What do I value?
            <p>
                <h3>
                    The foundation of my values is my faith in God, the creator of this world, and specifically Jesus.<br>
                    I know that a lot of people have heard of Jesus dying for them before, however, most don't know Him or His love for them.<br>
                    We have all fallen short over and over again, and we can't make ammends on our own. Praise be to God who took our place and has saved us from death.<br>
                    In all that I do, I try my best to do it for His glory. He died for me, so that I may live for Him.<br><br>

                <h3>
                    <br>I also value the importance of family, and I am so greatful for my own.<br>
                    In addition to that, I am a proud American citizen who values freedom, work ethic, leadership, and humilty.<br>
                    I wish that everyone knew that they were created with a purpose, and that they were loved before they were even born.<br>
                    Which leads me to my final statement: I value the life that God has given me, and the time I have from Him to share His love with others.<br>
